# My Crypto App Server

## Note 

You might be wondering why I would use Firebase for Auth but not their noSQL database solutons which integrate so nicely. I've thought about this a considerable amount but ultimately decided to go with MongoDB despite the additional, unneccesarry, complexity since it gives me the opportunity to learn a more universal skillset than just Firebase methods.
