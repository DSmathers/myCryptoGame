# A Cryptocurrency Trading Simulation Game

This is a personal project and currently still in development. 

## Introduction

A mock cryptocurrency exchange to gain experience and learn about trading crypocurrency without risking real life capital. 

## Goal(s)

My goal is to create a learning platform for people to explore the world of cryptocurrency and simulate the trading experience without any risk. My main intention is to use this as a portfolio project to assist me in landing that ellusive Junior Developer position. Feel free to judge my work and if you have the time, I'm open to all suggestions.
